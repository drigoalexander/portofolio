## A Vision Takes Shape

In my fourth semester at university, I embarked on a journey that would redefine my path. The spark ignited within the confines of ITS MUN CLUB, where the ambitious idea of organizing Surabaya MUN began to take form. The scale of this event was daunting, but as soon as I heard about it, I had a vision â€“ creating a website for Surabaya MUN. This is the story of how that vision came to life.

## Building a Supportive Team

With my team of friends by my side, I approached the organization's leadership with the proposal to create a website for Surabaya MUN. To my delight, the proposal was met with approval, granting us the opportunity to embark on this ambitious project. This section delves into the initial steps of our journey and the excitement that accompanied the project's approval.

## Lessons in Teamwork and Learning

Our journey was not without its challenges. Unfamiliar with the Laravel framework, we embarked on a steep learning curve, working tirelessly for three months to complete the project. Despite the website's imperfections, it marked a significant milestone for us, teaching us invaluable lessons in teamwork, adaptability, and responsibility. This final section reflects on the growth and learning that stemmed from this project and its lasting impact on our journeys.

i still remember how absurd my code was when simply use disabled property on the html to block navigation, as if i remember that moment now i can't stop smilling

here's the snippet of the code

```html
<div
  class="flex py-2 justify-center bg-gray-700 text-gray-300 line-through "
  disabled
  style="pointer-events: none"
>
  <a href="{{route('registMUN')}}" disabled style="pointer-events: none">MUN</a>
</div>
<div
  class="flex py-2 justify-center bg-gray-700 text-gray-300 line-through "
  disabled
>
  <a href="{{route('regisweb')}}" disabled>Webinar</a>
  <div
    class="flex py-2 justify-center bg-gray-700 text-gray-300 line-through "
    disabled
    style="pointer-events: none"
  >
    <a href="{{route('regisweb')}}" disabled style="pointer-events: none"
      >Webinar</a
    >
  </div>
</div>
```

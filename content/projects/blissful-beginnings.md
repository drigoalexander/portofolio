In recent years, Indonesia has experienced an incredible surge in internet usage, connecting a staggering 77.02% of its population by 2022.

As more couples turn to the web for their nuptial needs, wedding vendors find themselves grappling with a unique set of challenges.

One of the most significant obstacles faced by both vendors and customers in this digital age is the issue of credibility. With a plethora of wedding services available online, ranging from event management and venue selection to bridal makeup and overall event coordination, customers are often left bewildered by the complex array of decisions they must make. Moreover, the high costs and substantial time investments associated with these services add further complexity to the equation.

## The Project Vision

In light of these challenges, a groundbreaking project has emerged, aiming to transform the wedding industry in Indonesia. The central goal of this project is to simplify the process of customizing wedding packages through the creation of user-friendly websites.

## Streamlining the Wedding Planning Experience

To achieve this goal, the project proposes the integration of Google Forms into vendor websites. This integration offers a streamlined registration process for crews and third-party partners, simplifying their involvement in the wedding planning process.
